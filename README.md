# weather-notification-system
This Python application fetches weather forecasts from the OpenWeatherMap API and sends notifications about significant weather conditions (rain, snow, extreme heat) via Twilio SMS. It also logs notifications to a text file for later reference. The script is highly customizable and allows users to input their location and desired forecast duration.
